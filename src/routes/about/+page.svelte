	<h1>About Me *notice*</h1>
	<p>Hey there!</p>
	<p>
		So, I have some news for you about this site. This was a project I had been working on for almost 2 years now, I really loved adding features to
		this site, jumped from one framework to another, spent hours debugging, deployed silly code to production â€” it's a long story. However, due to
		some big exams that I need to take, I won't be able to work on it for a while. How long? well, nearly 2 years. I know, I know, it sucks. Many of
		you might know which exams I'm talking about. (<span> *cough* JEE *cough* </span>)

	<p>
		But seriously, I've got a LOT of studying to do and I won't be able to code for a while. So, some of the pages might be a little wonky, and some
		stuff might not work right. So apologies for that. I'll try to fix them when I get time, but I can't promise anything.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, I just wanted to let you know what's going on. Don't worry, though - I'll be back at it as soon as I can. In the meantime, keep checking
		the site for updates and don't hesitate to <a href="/contact">drop me a line if you've got any questions or comments.</a>
	</p>
	<p>Thanks for your understanding, and catch ya later!</p>
	<p>
		Best regards, <br />
